# Relationship between pace of life and heart disease.

## Question of Interest - Is pace of life related to heart diseases?

In four regions of the US (Northeast, Midwest, South and West), the researchers chose three different  metropolitan cities, three medium sized cities, three smaller cities, and then measured the indicators of pace of life. The aim of the study was to understand the relationship between heart diseases and pace of life. They used following variables to measure pace of life:

* **Walk** - The variable Walk is the walking speed of pedestrians over a distance of 60 feet during business hours on a clear summer day alog a main downtown street. 

* **Bank** - It is the average time a sample of bank clerks take to make change of two $20 bills.

* **Talk** - It is the recorded responses of postal clerks explaining the difference between regular,cerified, and insured mail and by diving the total number of syllables by the time of their responses.

* **Heart** - The researchers also obtained the age adjusted death rates from ischemic heart disease for each city.
